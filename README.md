# Welcome to the Angler Corner!

A simple leaderboard app with a hall of fame, a queue, and a non-destructive form of data-handling!
Please feel free to modify this project into any kind of leaderboard you like! I just made it with [A Simple Fishing World](https://vrclist.com/world/774958) on VRChat in mind!

You can test the app with TestFlight if you'd like! Link is here: [Angler Corner on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/s4r9QPQS)
